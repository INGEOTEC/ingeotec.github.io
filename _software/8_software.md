description: Connects SimilaritySearch with manifold Learning and also provides a high-performance UMAP method.
---

A package that implements the UMAP algorithm for computing non-linear dimensional projections. It uses the SimilaritySearch package for speeding up the construction of the 
knn graph and predictions. It also implements the necessary methods to use SimilaritySearch with external manifold learning methods, like those defined in the ManifoldLearning package.
