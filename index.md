In late 2014, researchers from [CentroGEO](http://www.centrogeo.org.mx) 
and [INFOTEC](http://infotec.mx) decided to work on interdisciplinary 
projects; this collaboration was framed under the INGEOTEC name. The founding 
members are:
- [Daniela Moctezuma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SbtmwwsAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao)
- Elio Villaseñor
- [Eric S. Tellez](https://sadit.github.io) [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6hmLQWsAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao)
- [Mario Graff](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=euNI6oEAAAAJ&hl=es), 
- [Oscar S. Siordia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E3azxIkAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra)
- [Sabino Miranda Jiménez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KSlujd4AAAAJ&hl=es)

As expected, during this period, some of the founding members moved to other institutions and campuses; Elio Villaseñor is working at [INEGI](https://inegi.org.mx/), and Oscar S. Siordia is now at CentroGEO campus Mérida.
