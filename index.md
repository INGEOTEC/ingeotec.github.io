In late 2014, researchers from [CentroGEO](http://www.centrogeo.org.mx) 
and [INFOTEC](http://infotec.mx) decided to work on interdisciplinary 
projects; this collaboration was framed under the INGEOTEC name. The founding 
members are:
- [<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square"></i>](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SbtmwwsAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) [Daniela Moctezuma](https://dmocteo.github.io/) 
- [<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square"></i>](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=N144SCkAAAAJ&hl=es) Elio Villaseñor
- [<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square"></i>](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6hmLQWsAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) [Eric S. Tellez](https://sadit.github.io/) 
- [<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square"></i>](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=euNI6oEAAAAJ&hl=es) [Mario Graff](https://mgraffg.github.io/)
- [<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square"></i>](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E3azxIkAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) Oscar S. Siordia
- [<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square"></i>](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KSlujd4AAAAJ&hl=es) Sabino Miranda Jiménez

As expected, during this period, some of the founding members moved to other institutions and campuses; Elio Villaseñor is working at [INEGI](https://inegi.org.mx/), and Oscar S. Siordia is now at CentroGEO campus Mérida.
